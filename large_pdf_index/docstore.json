Analysts, investment banks, think tanks and global\nagencies have all provided gushing salutes to the potential of India in\nterms of its size, workforc e and geopolitical central ity. A key\nunderpinning of this optimism  is the soft infrastructure the country\nhas put in place through an industrial-scale rollout of digital\nconnectivity that has allowed people to link their bank accounts to a\nnational identity number and a mobile phone number . Amongst\nothers, this linkage is promisi ng financial inclusion of over 500 million\npeople at the bottom of the income pyramid. But has financial\ninclusion truly reached this group? This research-based effort by\nChowdhry and Ahmed provid es an incredible window into the reach\nof financial inclusion to India ns. The reality , as they reveal, is not\nnecessarily what the popular narrative suggests. The authors\nillustrate the various ways in which schemes like the Pradhan Mantri\nJan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) have failed to achieve real financial\ninclusion for people at the bottom of the pyramid. The beauty of the\nbook, however , lies in how the authors provide a rubric to evaluate\nfinancial inclus ion schemes (SHUb\u2014simple, human and ubiquitous)\nand then examine where some of these schemes fall short. My\npersonal favou rites are the chapters on the importance of a voice\ninterface and the one on \u201cBan k Balance Batao\u201d which illustrates why\nvoice matters.

All the newspaper  coverage,\nonline posts, and web and journal articles will have us believe that\nfinancial inclusion has arrive d for the Bottom of the Pyramid (BOP)\npopulation.\nIt has not.\nWell, not yet.\nThe number of bank accounts opened under the Pradhan Mantri\nJan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) is around 49 crore (490 million) and the\naggregate account balance in them is almost Rs 2 lakh crore ($24\nbillion). This may look good  per se.1 Still, they do not reflect the\nrealities of dormant accounts  (almost one out of every five accounts\nremains dormant),2 coerci vely opened accoun ts that are rarely\nserviced,3 and the relucta nce of bank officials to open such accounts\nafter a publicized drive.

Why have our well-intentioned plans not worked fast\nenough?\nThroughout this book, we will explore why many of the existing\nsolutions have faltered and fumbled along their path to inclusion. We\nwill reveal, through what we now call the SHUb Test ( shub  also\nmeans auspicious in Hindi) that each of these solutions has failed.\nThrough the course of our research, which was designed to\nascertain the causes of financial exclusion and to propose alternate\nsolutions that would aid in inclusion, we found that any solution, tool\nor technology that was deplo yed for the BOP group need ed to pass\nthrough three filters:\nIt must be Simple .\nIt must be Human.\nAnd it must be Ubiquitous .\nIn short, it must be SHUb.\nSimple : The first filter is that of simplicity . Banking and financial\nproducts need to be simple in order for financial inclusion to be\nsuccessful because simplicity allows more people to understand and\nuse these products. When solutions are complex or confusing, it can\nbe difficult for people to understand how they work, what they are\nused for and how to access them. This can lead to a lack of trust in\nthese products, which can prevent people from using them.\nSimplicity is essential for financial inclusion because it allows\npeople who may not have a lot of education or financial literacy to\nunderstand and use these products. When products are simple, it is\neasier for people to make informed decisions about their finances,\nand it is more likely that they will use these products to improve their\nfinancial well-being.\nIn addition to helping people  understand and use these products,\ntheir simplicity also makes it easier for financial institutions  to provide\nthem to a wider range of customers.

This can help financial institutions reach more\npeople and provide better services to their customers.\nHuman:  The second filter is that of the human touch. Financial\nproducts must have a human touch if we want them to be inclusive\nbecause this is what helps build trust and improve the experience of\nthe BOP group. When peopl e have access to banking and financial\nproducts that are personalized and provide a human connection, it\ncan help them feel more comfortable and confident in using these\nproducts. This is particularly important for people who may not have\na lot of experience with financial products or who may be hesitant to\nuse them.\nHuman touch can also help provide support and guidance to\ncustomers who may need assistance with using these products. This\ncan include providing advic e on how to manage their finances,\nhelping customers understand how to use different products and\naddressing any questions or concerns they may have. When people\nfeel they are being supported  and they have someone to turn to for\nhelp, they are more likely to use these products and trust the\nfinancial institutions that provide them.\nUbiquitous: The final filter is ubiquity . Financial solutions need to\nbe ubiquitous in order to ensure people have access to these\nproducts regar dless of where they live or what their circumstances\nare. Ubiquity refers to the availability of something everywhere or the\nfact that it is present in all places at all times.

If one relies entirely on\ncash, they are excluded from all the wonderful things promised by\nthe digital revolution.\nWhat Is not SHUb?\nElectronic payments are not SHUb.

Our voices\nare not just sounds produced in the larynx; they are also very\nintegral to our personalities.  The specific tone and timbre of our\nvoices give them a distinct identity , much like our fingerprints. In fact,\non several occasions, investigative agencies have relied upon the\nscientific breakdown of voice indicators to narrow down suspects.\nSophisticated software programmes in forensic laboratories can\nmatch voice samples with near certainty , and this technology is no\nlonger limited to military and government use but is seeing\nwidespread commercial adoption globally by organizations to\nauthenticate and protect their customers from fraud.\nThere are other ways in which voices act as identity markers.\nThere are para-linguistic and non-linguistic indicators as well. For\ninstance, by simply listening to a voice, you can establish the gender\nand approxima te age of the speaker . Accents, which are inextricably\ntied to our voices, can help in placing an individual at an approximate\nlocation on the globe with a fair amount of accuracy .\nVoices have such a distinctiv e quality about them that many of us\nhave memories  related to them. We can clearly recall the stories that\nwere narrated to us in the distinct voices of our family members,\nparents, or even beloved grandparents who may have passed away .\nSometimes, even famous voices have recall: in India, for example,\nsingers such as Kishore Kumar , Lata Mangeshkar , Asha Bhosle and\nMohammed Rafi enjoy legendary status because of their inimitable\nvoices. In Indian radio, Ameen Sayani has enthralled audiences\nacross generations.

There is\nevidence from studies condu cted at the University of Helsinki and\nthe University of South Caroli na to suggest that children in the womb\ncan not only hear voices but also distinguish between different\nvoices as early as thirty-two weeks of gestation. Furthermore, they\nfound that foetuses demonstrated a preference for human voices\nover computer-generated speech while in the womb.1\nRadios may not be as popular as they were decades ago, but\npodcasts have picked up. So many of us choose to turn on an\napplication to listen to soothing sounds before we go to bed, or even\nlisten to a podcast in the sonorous voices of our favourite artists.\nSuch is the ef fect that voices can have on humans.\nA case in point is Disney movies. Disney has largely been  making\nanimated movies, but these have done as much business as non-\nanimated featu res with real people acting in them. It can be argued\nthat it is the voices that make the animated films appear almost real\nand give them that lifelike quality that Disney is known for. That, and,\nof cours e, the superior animation. It\u2019s believed that the actors who\nlend their voice s to animated movies are paid on par with their other\nacting roles. Children find an emotional connection to voices rather\nthan real-life visuals, which Disney movies have successfully\nharnessed for decades.\nAnimated movies are not the only places we encounter \u2018voices\u2019\nwithout the people they belong to. Many of us might instantly recall\nthe unique voice that we\u2019ve heard in the recorded IVR of our cellular\nphone provider or the very distinctive voices that announ ce station\nnames on the Metro lines.\nIn early 2021, when the Government of India launched the COVID-\n19 vaccination drive, it was nothing short of a mammoth task. The\ngoal of vaccina ting the entire population was tremendous, to say the\nleast.

Bhishma was then stuck for a few\ndays until he had help from someone to deposit the money back into\nhis account.\nStories like those of Bhishm a\u2019s are, in fact, not rare at all. There\nare innumerable cases where  the inability to navigate the technology\noverwhelms the user at the ATM. Withdrawing extra money is just\none of the possible mistakes. Sometimes, even semi-literate users or\nusers with limited digital literacy may end up so confoun ded by the\noptions on the screen that they may drop the entire transaction\nmidway and return later when they have help.\nOne possible way of avoidin g such accidents is by making ATM\nkiosks entirely  voice enabled. While it\u2019s true that most ATMs come\nwith a voice configuration, they are usually limited to opening and\nclosing instruc tions. What if a voice had told Bhishma, \u2018You have\nentered Rs 10,000. Are you sure you want to withdraw Rs 10,000?\u2019\nThis is to say that the chances of a customer responding to a\nvoice-enabled ATM are much  higher than when he\u2019s transacting on a\nnon-voice-enabled ATM. In the case of an ATM transaction, the aid\nwould be more auditory in nature but would ensure similar results\nwith fewer mistakes.\nWe have about 2.5 lakh ATMs installed across the country .\nNaturally , most of these are concentrated in high-density areas or\nurban areas.

He\nprefers his old ways of going to the branch, withdrawing money ,\nsmiling at the staff who have aged with him, and transacting with\nhumans instead of machines. He distinctly remembers the few\noccasions when he had tried to operate the ATM on his own but just\ncouldn\u2019t seem to get it right. For the teacher in him, it was a\nparticularly uncomfortable situation to be in. So, he gave up\ntechnology entirely in favour of a method that actually worked for\nhim.\nDespite his aversion to technology , Sridhar does operate a\nsmartphone without much difficulty as he uses the \u2018Easy Mode\u2019.\nWhen one chooses this mode, the user interface changes\ncompletely .

This app is particularly\nnoteworthy because it is the first of its kind in India to use artificial\nintelligence and machine learning to enable voice search and\nassistance, making it capable of understanding not just languages\nbut even dif ferent dialects within a language.\nThe use of voice technology in the Ujjivan Mobile Banking  app has\nseveral benefit s for users like Bhishma and Sridhar , who may not be\ncomfortable with traditional, text-based interfaces. For example, the\nrecorded audio guide on every screen provides an additional layer of\nguidance and support for account holders who may have limited\nliteracy . The app\u2019s visual representations of physical banking\ntransactions through images, such as paying an EMI or depositing\nmoney at a bank, also help to bridge the gap between the physical\nand digital worlds and make  the app more accessible to the semi-\nliterate. So, Bhishma, whose reading speed may be very limited, can\nlook at an image and immediately know what that option could be.\nMost users who have limited digital literacy also end up only\npartially using all the feature s and benefits that their bank account\ncomes with.

Keeping them\nbonded to loans that continued to yield high rates of interest was\nimportant to lenders, and they freely exploited the relationship to that\nend.\nThe moneylenders operate differently now, as compared to the\ntimes in which Premchand wrote.

People were already borrowing from him. A\nrelationship his father had started and so assiduously cultivated\ncould not be put to an end just like that.\nAnd so, it came about that Subu just accepted his fate and\nbecame a part-time moneyle nder. Now his clientele expects him to\ndrop in once a week, even if they\u2019re not due to pay.

Here, her ability to\nread and write was not sufficient to understand the requirements of\nthe form and what she needed was some help in learning about\nbasic banking terms and processes.\nSimilarly digital literacy has its own shades as we have seen\nduring many of field visits in rural areas where we have come across\nmany women proudly telling us that they now owned a smartphone\nand use it to communicate with family and friends, browse YouTube\nand watch movies and listen to news on their smartphones.

A Didi\u2019s clientele is gender , age and class\nagnostic. From literate elderly people who are simpl y wary of\ntechnology to men from the BOP with limited literacy to women who\nhave neither literacy nor digital know-how , a Didi is there for all.\nThere may be people who are fearful of transacting on their own\nbecause they worry about losing money . Having a human being\npresent during  the translation and, in fact, helping them close it,\ngives it legitimacy and a sense of closure\u2014that the transaction did\ngo through because a \u2018person\u2019 confirmed it and not a machine.

Her\ngender evokes trust almost  immediately , and calling her Didi, or\nsister , gives her respect even before she starts to trans act for her\ncustomers.\nHow Would the Digital Didi System Work?\nEach transaction that a Didi facilitates could be tagged with Digital\nDidi\u2019s identity for accountability and incentives. For instance, each\nDidi has her own QR code. Anyone approaching her need s to simply\nscan the code and access the Didi app, where the Digital Didi\ntransacts on their behalf. Didis would be paid a small stipend by\nbanks or financial institution s, and this would be something Didis\nwould do not necessarily full time but in their downtime, as they walk\nabout doing their other daily chores, including going to or back from\nschool or college, shopping or other leisurely activities. She could be\nanybody and a Didi. She could be a homemaker , a tailor , a factory\nsupervisor or even a teacher opting to be a Didi in her downtime.\nThe number of hours or even  minutes that a Didi works is entirely\nup to her .

Over time, people will begin to know and\ntrust a few Didis who will become their regular go-to Didis for help\nwith mobile financial transactions.\nRadhika, for instance, spends an hour every morning helping\npeople before she goes back  home to resume her chore s. Later in\nthe day, before she has to pick her children up again, she dons her\nwaistcoat again and turns into a Didi. She does it at will, working\nmore hours on one day, fewer on another . When her children are\nhome on holiday , she doesn\u2019t go at all. Being a Didi means making\nsome money on the side and achieving a modicum of financial\nindependence. She doesn\u2019t struggle to ask her husband for money\nwhen she needs it; he is a considerate and kind man, but just having\nher own money and not having to ask him makes Radhika happy .\nBeing a Didi keeps her socially active too. She recalls her pre-Didi\ndays, when she only had a few neighbours to talk to. But now, she\nmeets new people every day.

Over the years, he has become a\nfull-fledged grocer . His income grew slowly , and finally , there was\nsome money to put away for a rainy day. Like the rest of his family ,\nAjit too saved his money in a post of fice account.\nAfter the launch of the Pradh an Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY)\nin 2014 , Ajit opened an acco unt with a bank.

He needed money , of\ncourse. The option of a bank loan seemed to get more challenging\nas the days passed. To begin with, he could not fully unde rstand the\napplication process.

The last instalment of Rs 5000 (approximately $61) is due today .\nThe moneylender called to inform him that he would be there in the\nevening to pick it up. The problem is that he does not keep that\nmuch cash handy, so he\u2019ll need to withdraw from his bank account.\nBeing a busy day at the shop, Ajit decides not to go to the branch 7\nkm away but to the ATM instead, which is midway betwe en Azizpur\nand the next village.\nAjit has used the ATM card on a few occasions before, but always\nwith the assista nce of someone.

Finally , Ajit runs out of the booth and looks for the guard,\nwho usually sits outside. When Ajit narrates his ordeal to him and\nshows the receipt from the ATM, the guard answers cryptically ,\nsaying that this is most likely the outcome of a technical issue, and\nthat Ajit needs to take it up with the bank.\nAjit is beside himself with worry. He has never defaulted on his\npayments, and his credibility is at stake. Above all, this is his hard-\nearned money . It will take him several months to save this much\nagain. This is exactly why he didn\u2019t want to switch from the post\noffice in the first place or try using the ATM machines.

From booking tickets online for his frequent travels to making\npayments online on food delivery apps and monitoring his payments\non his banking app, he does  it all. It was little surprise then that he\nstarted using a credible-soun ding third-party service to pay his credit\ncard bills. The benefit was that he could consolidate all his cards in\none place and track their payments without worrying about missing\ndue dates. Things went well for the first few months. Then, on one\noccasion, he had to make a few large payments in one go.\nIn Anas \u2019 case, the funds got deducted twice  from his account, but\nthe banks to whom he had to make the payments had not received\nthe money. So, between him and the bank, the third party probably\nhad the money since the money had to be somewhere. Only when\nhe tried reaching out to the third-party service provider did Anas\nrealize that there was no way of reaching them. There was no toll-\nfree number , no chat option, and no customer service at all.\nSo even  though there was a customer who was very motivated to\nregister a complaint to retriev e his money and who had the technical\nknowledge and wherewithal to do so, the means just did not exist.\nThe third party , which was popular and seemingly credible in the\nmarket, had not provided any options for their customers to reach\nout in times of need like this.\nEventually , Anas did get his money back. It took three anxious\nworking days and a lot of crossing fingers. Unwilling to go through a\nsimilar experie nce again, Anas has sworn off the app and has gone\nto other financial service providers to pay his credit card bills.\nWhen it comes to money , people are very cautious; they count the\nmoney carefully , sometimes even more than once, before parting\nwith it.

Prior to the implementation of the\nIntegrated Ombudsman Scheme, consumers may have had to\nnavigate multiple channels in order to file a complaint or track the\nstatus of their case. The Integrated Ombudsman Scheme aims to\nsimplify this process by offering a single portal, email address, and\nphysical location where consumers can report their complaints and\nsubmit supporting documents.\nWhile the Integrated Ombudsman Scheme provides a centralized\nway for consumers to address their grievances, it is important to note\nthat it is not the first point of recourse and would seem daunting to\nmost users. Consumers are required to try to resolve their issues\ndirectly with the service provider before escalating their complaints to\nthe Integrated Ombudsman Scheme. However , if a resolution cannot\nbe reached through the service provider , the Integrated Ombudsman\nScheme serves as a last resort where consumers can take their\ncomplaints. The two-tiered system ensures that consum ers have\nmultiple options for addressing their grievances and that the\nIntegrated Ombudsman Scheme is only utilized as a last resort.\nDespite the existence of the Integrated Ombudsman Scheme,\naccessing its mechanisms for resolving issues or complaints is not a\nstraightforward process.

Banks could engage a third-party insurance provider who\nwould basically underwrite the losses of faulty transactions, and it\ncould help streamline the redressal process even further . For\ninstance, think of how air travel is insured at the time of flight\nbooking. At a minimal cost, one can insure themselves against loss\nof baggage, flight delays, etc.\nSimilarly , all digital transactions could be brought under the scope\nof an insurance  provider . As part of the claims process, the provider\nwould immediately be able to identify disputed transactions,\ntransactions made in error or any other kind of grievance that\ncustomers may have. The comfort of knowing that an insurance\nprovider is underwriting potentially faulty transactions can boost the\nconfidence of BOP customers and would most likely encourage\nmore digital use.\nThe insurance  provider investigates each case and provides\nredressal on behalf of the bank. However , unlike insured  air travel,\nwhere delays and baggage losses are well documented, in the case\nof digital transactions, errors may be more difficult to track. In other\nwords, fraudule nt claims may rise once the customer base is aware\nthat their transactions are insured. In such cases, the insurance\nprovider could analyse any patterns or trends that emerge and\ninform the bank. Say, for example, that there\u2019 s a sudden spike in\ndisputed cases from a certain digital platform, from a region or city,\nor even  from the same number . The banks can be alerted, a more\nthorough investigation can be conducted, and the fraudulent claims\ncan be denie d. Major credit card companies emplo y a fraud\nmanagement system along these lines.

Anil\ncould only do so much on the small plot by himself. Their already\npaltry income diminished. The fine balance that they had achieved\nwith their daily income from the land and their limited spending was\nirrevocably disturbed. Roopa \u2019s medication was expensive.

The best they could do was offer some sympathy and amounts\nof money so small that he would only be able to afford two days\u2019\nworth of medicines for Roopa. Feeling defeated and ashamed of\nhaving to ask for money , Anil finally decided to \u2018look outside\u2019. There\nwas nothing of value left with the Mahatos. The little jewellery they\nhad was already pawned a few years ago to get the land they now\ntill. The bank was not even an option for Anil. In his already depleted\nmental state, he did not have the resilience to jump through the\nhoops that a bank loan required. Besides, he needed the money\nimmediately . As early as that same evening. And so, Anil made that\nlong walk to the place he\u2019d dreaded all his life: the moneylender \u2019s\nhouse. His need was a far stronger driver than his fear of what might\nhappen in the future.\nInformal sources of credit, though expensive, are lifesavers in\nmany situation s when no other source of credit is available.

Leaving aside the inevitability of mortality ,\nsickness and death are inext ricably linked to the vagaries of nature.\nWhen it\u2019s not nature, then accidents and man-made calamities pose\na threat to life and general well-being. In essence, no human life is\nimmune to ill health, accidents, misfortune or financial losses. No\nmatter what the adversity , be it health, death, accidents,\nunemployment or the failure of the monsoons, all of these eventually\nresult in a financial crisis; such is the interconnectedness  of human\nlife and money .

You take care of me when I need help. I\nwill take care of you when you need help. That requires two things.\nGroups of people. And an ability to write social and formal contracts\n(collective intelligence and the ability to remember and reciprocate).\nHence, social institutions and social insurance.\nBut what if the entire group is threatened? That require s you to\nenlarge the group for diversification. But a larger group means less\nreliance on informal mechanisms like reciprocity . We need formal\nmechanisms called contracts, which lead to individu alism and\nreliance on market insurance. Formal development of these systems\ntakes resources, which poor societies can\u2019t afford. They are\ncompelled to rely on informal  mechanisms.

While largely formalized, some\nforms of insura nce have existed informally in the past too. The joint\nfamily system that continues to thrive in India has the need to\nmitigate financ ial risk at its very core. There are other sociological\nfactors too, but one cannot ignore the economics of the\narrangement. These forms of informal hedging come with several\nlimitations. The ability of a single big shock to wipe out entire families\nor even whole communities is just one of those limitations.\nRatnesh Bhai Shah is a pottery and terracotta craftsman who,\nalong with his newlywed wife, was travelling to Mumbai when a\nmassive earthquake hit Bhuj, Gujarat, in 2001. Back home in the\nvillage of Chobari, his extend ed family of four brothers, their wives,\nand several children were caught unaware on that fateful morning of\n26 Janu ary. It took Ratnesh Bhai several sleepless days and nights\nto finally get home, only to find that his entire family had perished\nand that the place he had called home his whole life had been\nlevelled by the quake. Ratne sh Bhai Shah\u2019 s family had been in the\npottery trade for generations , and by choice, they had continued to\nlive and work as a unit. This shared model of living and working had\nsaved them many a rainy day. He still remembers his grandmother\ntelling them tales under the night sky about how the elder  Shah and\nhis brothers had managed to complete a festive order on time only\nbecause they were together . And how the goddess at the temple had\nblessed them with prosperity  for generations after that. One of the\nreasons why the cousins and brothers never ventured far from the\nfamily home was this.

What Raadhi needed was comprehensive health\ncoverage to diversify her risks, which she did not have.\nWhat Could I Explore that Would Lead Me to\nthe Diversification of Risk?\nThis is what the financial markets allow us to do. In the jargon of\nfinancial economics, many risks can be diversified. For example, one\ncan protect oneself against many risks by buying insurance. Many\ninsurance products, such as life insurance, automobile  insurance\nand health insurance, exist and are used by millions of people. But\nas Robert J. Shiller , Nobel Laureate in Economics, has pointed out,\nthere are many other risks we face in life\u2014for example,\nunemployment risk\u2014and the level of formal insurance, or livelihood\ninsurance, is woefully inadequate. Furthermore, in a research paper\nby Shawn Cole, Xavier Gin\u00e9, Jeremy Tobacman, Petia Topalova,\nRobert Townsend and James Vickery ,1 they show , using evidence\nfrom India, that there are many barriers that have severely limited\nthe use of formal insurance contracts. They suggest that many poor\npeople don\u2019t buy insurance because they face liquidity and credit\nconstraints, do not trust formal insurance products, and sometimes\nthe advantages of insurance, such as large payouts in adverse\nsituations, are not often visible. Innovations in the private sector that\naddress these barriers can increase the use of formal insurance\nproducts.\nWhile these solutions may work and certainly ought to be given a\nshot, we suggest a different solution altogether . We propose a\nmarriage of formal insuran ce contracts with informal insurance\nmechanisms. Large institutions, such as self-help groups, local\nbanks and cooperatives, temple churches, mosques and\ngurudwaras, even state and central governments, can buy formal\ninsurance against the risks faced by people in the commu nities they\nserve.

Brijmohan\u2019 s earnings come in on a\ndaily basis, and they barely have any savings. His wife, Manorama,\nuses his daily income as judiciously as she can to ensure that they\nhave the necessities that they need. She buys just enough groceries\nand vegetables to last them a few days. For one, they don\u2019t have a\nrefrigerator or a large enoug h kitchen to stock too much at home.\nBesides, they usually have just enough cash to buy for a few days at\na time.\nNow that you know both of our protagonists, let\u2019s understand their\nspending patterns:\nWhen the Mathurs go to their regular supermarket in the mall,\nMeeta Mathur prefers to buy a 5-kg dal packet for Rs 590\n(approximately $7) that would last them for five weeks.

In fact, she might\ndo this twice a week, or ten times over, by the time the Mathurs run\nout of dal.\nManorama does this because she only has a few hundred  rupees\nto buy groceries for a few days. If she did have  Rs 500\n(approximately $6) to begin with, she would\u2019ve probably put it away\nfor a rainy day, not knowing when her husband\u2019 s daily income might\nbe af fected.\nBrijmohan makes about Rs 600\u2013800 (approximately $13\u2013$10) a\nday after payin g for the rent of his autorickshaw and the fuel.

Arguably , Manorama is also buying unbranded, inferior-quality\ndal. The paradox here is that Meeta pays less because she\u2019s richer ,\nand Manorama pays more because she\u2019s poor. This phenomenon is\nalso called the poverty premium or the poverty tax.\nThe concept of the poverty premium is relevant to many countries,\nincluding India. In India, low-income individuals and households may\nface a number  of additional costs that can make it more difficult for\nthem to make ends meet. These costs can take many forms, such as\nhigher prices for goods and services, higher fees for basic services,\nand higher interest rates on loans.\nBesides Manorama\u2019 s example, another example of the poverty\npremium in India is the cost of healthcare. Low-income individuals in\nIndia may have limited access to preventive care, leading to higher\ncosts for the treatment of preventable conditions. They may also be\nmore likely to rely on emergency rooms for medical care,  which can\nbe more expensive than primary care. In addition, the cost of\nprescription drugs can be a significant burden for low-income\nindividuals, as they may be unable to afford the cost of necessary\nmedications.\nAnother exam ple of the poverty premium in India is the cost of\ntransportation. Low-income individuals in India may be more likely to\nlive in areas with limited public transportation options, leading to\nhigher costs for transportatio n to work or to access other necessary\nservices. In addition, the cost of owning and maintaining a vehicle\ncan be a significant burden for low-income households.\nThe poverty premium is a complex issue influenced by a variety of\nfactors, including access to credit, bargaining power and the costs\nassociated with serving low-income markets.

In his work, Sen argues that poverty is not\njust a lack of income but also a lack of access to resources and\nopportunities that are necessary for a minimally decent life. Sen\u2019s\nwork on the concept of \u2018capability deprivation\u2019 has been influential in\nshaping our understanding of the ways in which economic systems\ncan disproportionately impact the poor .\nIn an earlier chapter , we discussed how moneylenders charge the\npoor exorbitan t rates of interest because they do not have access to\nformal channels of borrowing.

That amounts to a loan at an effective annual interest rate of\nover 200 per cent! Again, no greedy moneylenders are present here,\njust your friendly neighbourhood kirana guy. And this picture\nrepeatedly occurs all over the country , for hundreds of millions of the\npoor population. If you find the presence of moneylenders charging\n40 per cent or 50 per cent annual rates of interest disturbing, you\nshould be equally concerned about the exorbitant costs that poor\npeople are forced to incur for their everyday purchases because we\nhave not offered them the simple and inexpensive financial credit", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2017, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d40b4b63-7de7-47ff-bbb6-25352b2b0baf": {"__data__": {"id_": "d40b4b63-7de7-47ff-bbb6-25352b2b0baf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "153", "file_name": "FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_path": "/content/FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1576605, "creation_date": "2024-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a6e018eb-ba7c-4a2c-b7a8-70ed05836235", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "153", "file_name": "FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_path": "/content/FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1576605, "creation_date": "2024-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-02"}, "hash": "87f1c1630eeb989e9c0a0b6c1300b23ec52d6d808923e24bc1008f24ba63fe0b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0345a230-c53d-4842-9f51-4bc5994f7cc7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "152", "file_name": "FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_path": "/content/FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1576605, "creation_date": "2024-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-02"}, "hash": "97ffde4ff9dc1fb80d39a1a206073ec095d1f17ff7b879c176d265cc0ab6f0de", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b09ff9fb-d621-44a3-ab15-c4fc2c91d242", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5513fa20f216d51a3f4d9f36e33766ffc5f6c31f2916c29b7418fdabe62da10e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "products that you and I get easily .

If\nthese instrume nts have the potential to change the game for the\nmiddle-income population, one then wonders if the poor should also\nhave easy access to equity investments through mutual funds.\nWell, not yet.\nEquity investm ents come with inherent risks, and it is important to\napproach them with caution. It can be tempting to be swayed by the\nprospect of high past returns;  and the poor at the BOP are especially\nvulnerable to this kind of temptation that hints at disproportionate\nreturns. This fascination with monetary fates turning overnight is\nalready seeded into our culture through folklore and stories and is\nfuelled by the more recent bourgeoning of reality television and\ngame shows that can turn people into \u2018crorepatis\u2019 overnight.

But while the price in 2000 was Rs 14,973\n(approximately $183), it went down to Rs 10,362 (approximately\n$126) in 2006.  It went up to Rs 31,902 (approximately $389) in 2013,\nbut again went down to Rs 24,854 (approximately $304) in 2015.1\nThe volatility of returns on gold is quite high, and the average\nreturns over long periods of time could be no better or worse than\ninvesting in safe government securities. For example, if you had\ninvested Rs 9873 (approximately $120) in government securities in\n1991 in India, it would have become Rs 52,980 (approximately $646)\nby 2022\u2014but without the roller-coaster price rises and falls\nassociated with gold.2 Gold is best thought of as a hedge against\nmarket risk. That is, the price of gold tends to move oppo sitely from\nthe overall portfolio of stocks. So, having a little bit of gold in addition\nto a portfolio of risky stocks makes immense sense.\nBut investing in gold alone is not a great investment.\nSo, should the poor stay satisfied with the meagre returns that\nsavings instruments offer while the middle- and upper-income\npopulations get richer as the economy grows? We suggest a simple\nalternative.\nCash \u2018n\u2019 Ladder", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1842, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b71503ce-5571-444a-aa03-cdbd46e7959e": {"__data__": {"id_": "b71503ce-5571-444a-aa03-cdbd46e7959e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "164", "file_name": "FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_path": "/content/FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1576605, "creation_date": "2024-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-02"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f3300c3b-3238-44a3-87c4-90629f55c059", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "164", "file_name": "FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_path": "/content/FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1576605, "creation_date": "2024-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-02"}, "hash": "5b99909b5276011d9dbd7d3f1fe3d6198a146e9f623e969a14222f83d5f45257", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e10a1a75-a191-42a0-b69c-fe28074cc876", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "163", "file_name": "FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_path": "/content/FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1576605, "creation_date": "2024-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-02"}, "hash": "a15ac4fb3e167ff790ff05d31fb17804d0169cb37fb363d0d6d1fa93e0448f9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6336bee8-1655-419c-95b7-c7ca39dc1cb7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "40ceea2db0c666f0bc821eb4ed93813d2504900f880d89f9dc7d0e30d3c90470", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The sage advice about risky equity investments is that you should\nonly invest an amount that you can afford to lose. That is what risk-\nbearing capacity means. We suggest a simple product that we call\nCash \u2018 n\u2019 Ladder .\nCash \u2018n\u2019 Ladde r offers a floor on how low your investment  can fall.\nFor example, one can promise that the principal amount you invest\nwill be preserved. Any intere st that is accumulated on the principal\namount could be invested in a risky stock portfolio.\nFor instance, let\u2019s suppose you invest Rs 100 (approximately $1).\nLet us also suppose that interest on a one-year fixed deposit is 8 per\ncent per annum. One can invest Rs 92.60 (approximately $1) in a\nfixed deposit, which will grow to Rs 100 in a year. This guarantees\nthat in one year, your principal investment of Rs 100 (approximately\n$1) is guaranteed. The remaining Rs 7.40 (approximately $0.090)\ncan then be invested in a risky stock portfolio. This guarantees that\nthe minimum you will have at the end of the year is Rs 100.\nIn addition, imagine that a Rs 7.40 investment in stocks grows to\nRs 12 (approximately 0.15 which is not guaranteed). Your balance at\nthe end of the year is now Rs 112 (approximately $1.5). You can now\nbe asked again if you want to put a higher floor on your investment.\nYou are climbing a ladder , so to speak. You can decide that the new\nladder step is Rs 110 (approximately $1.5). That can now be\nguaranteed by a fixed-deposit investment of Rs 101.85\n(approximately $1.25), which at 8 per cent will grow to Rs 110. The\nremaining (Rs 112 \u2013 Rs 101.85) Rs 10.15 can again be invested in a\nrisky stock portfolio. And so on.\nThis ensures that your savin gs grow on a ladder on which you\nnever go down  but only go up. Sometimes in big steps, sometimes in\nsmall steps, and in the worst case, you stay at the same step on the\nladder .\nIt is time we included the poor in our growth journey . We can do it\nresponsibly , with complete transparency , and with the safety that the\npoor so value.

Baldev is grateful that he\nhasn\u2019t faced such dire times in several years. The last time it\nhappened was because he was bedridden with typhoid for a month or\nso, which meant that they had to use up whatever little he had saved\nbefore that. One severe case of typhoid had wiped out his whole life\u2019s\nsavings in two months.\nThis is why he\u2019s already teaching his ten-year-old son his craft. He\nbelieves it\u2019s never too early to learn, and the sooner his son starts to\naugment their income, the better it will be for all of them.\nOne of the BCs he sometimes goes to for bank-related work\nadvised Baldev to start saving formally , but Baldev just shook his\nhead at the idea. There was barely any money to begin with. Of what\nuse would it be lying in a bank account far away where he couldn\u2019t\neven see it? At home, even if it didn\u2019t multiply , at least he could keep\nan eye on it. And not like the few hundreds or thousands he could\nmuster would grow much anyway .\nThe BC reminded him about the time when he lost his livelihood\njust because he\u2019d fallen ill. At times like these, insurance services\ncould be very useful to Balde v. All he\u2019d have to do is put aside some\nmoney for a health emergency , especially given how prone he is to\nillness because of his vocation. But Baldev just shrugged at the sky\nand lamented that God would look after him like he had so many", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2084, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd6aea93-295e-4221-8132-e0ac5382a13c": {"__data__": {"id_": "cd6aea93-295e-4221-8132-e0ac5382a13c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "181", "file_name": "FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_path": "/content/FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1576605, "creation_date": "2024-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-02", "entities": ["Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b135fe39-ff7f-4265-b98e-d048e6fae639", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "181", "file_name": "FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_path": "/content/FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1576605, "creation_date": "2024-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-02"}, "hash": "2760bb90a37d1ec19e2bc987ff8be9f0222b4d948a4efec6c9aef29c5e9075f9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b21bf8ed-3e31-4aa9-8a90-f2ac427c3ee9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_path": "/content/FinTech for Billions - Bhagwan Chowdhry & Syed Anas Ahmed.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1576605, "creation_date": "2024-03-02", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-02", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-02"}, "hash": "a3020d0f1b1fc67b10cbb2ca10a986b0b8411571dd855d25a12f40210828b5dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c6a2a403-10e9-40c4-a9f4-bf47398643eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2784a6c99ece7132dad48e0352f5a7c5d6154e7eab19b5c216d394a113a7d674", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "before him.

Of course,\nbuilding and maintaining infrastructure costs money . An important\nquestion is: where would the funds for infrastructure come from? A\nbasic principle  of economics suggests that a person who uses any\nprivate  good, such as a camera or a bicycle, must pay for it. This\nwillingness to pay generate s demand for a private good, which\ninduces others  in society to produce that good and supply it using\nmarkets. A famous quote from Adam Smith\u2019 s classic treatise aptly\ndescribes this phenomenon.\n\u2018It is not from the benevolence of the butcher , the brewer , or the\nbaker that we expect our dinner , but from their regard to their own\nself-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their\nself-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their\nadvantages.\u2019 \u2014Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature and\nCauses of the W ealth of Nations , Volume 1.\nInfrastructure, however , is not a private good. It is a public good\nthat is used and enjoyed by everyone, irrespective of their\neconomics or their politics. Roads are an example of this kind of\npublic good. A driveway leading to your house from the main street\nmay be a private good because only you, your family  and any\nvisitors coming to your home benefit from it. So, you pay for it when\nyou build the house, maintain it and have it cleaned regularly .
