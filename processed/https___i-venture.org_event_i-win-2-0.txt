I-WIN 2.0

October 27, 2023 





« I-Mentor @ ISB | Session 2











I-Venture @ ISB’s Women of Innovation Program aims to provide acceleration support to women-founded/co-founded start-ups by handholding entrepreneurs through their scaling-up journey.
The accelerator is designed to focus on leveraging ISB’s strong network to enable women to scale their products/services. Women entrepreneurs can then glide through to the Go-to-Market stage and work on scaling up through focused guidance, workshops, shared learning, and networking along with a platform for fundraising with extensive business growth opportunities.
Our I-WIN (Women of Innovation) 2.0 accelerator program, wraps up on a high note with an intense demo day that brought 14 investors and the cohort together, engaging them in 1-on-1 pitching over 80+ in-person meetings.
