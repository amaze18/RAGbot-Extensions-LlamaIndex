Knowledge Series (I-Venture @ ISB) | Episode – 4

August 21, 2023 





« 4th edition I-Connect @ ISB
I-Mentor @ ISB | Session 2 »










Entrepreneurship is a complex and multifaceted endeavour that involves a range of skills and knowledge, from business planning and financial management to marketing and sales, team building, and more.
We believe by providing access to information and resources that will help founders develop these skills and knowledge, we can create a more vibrant and thriving startup ecosystem.
This episode featured Aswath Damodaran, Professor of Finance at NYU Stern School of Business, taking us back to the basics of understanding and valuing young companies. He shed light on the topic of “Startup Valuation”.
