FAQs 



 






Does a non-profit social enterprise qualify for the program?

No. You should be a for-profit social enterprise and rely on market forces, with customers or clients purchasing your products or services.







What are the criteria on which a startup will be evaluated?

There are five main criteria that the selection committee will take into account: sustainability, scalability, replicability, environmental impact and social impact of the startup. In addition to these five criteria, the committee will also consider a startup’s uniqueness, quality of the team and current traction of the company.
