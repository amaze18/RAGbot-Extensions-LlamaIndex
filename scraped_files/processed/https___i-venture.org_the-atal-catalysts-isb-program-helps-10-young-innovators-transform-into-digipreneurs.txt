NewsThe Atal Catalysts @ ISB program helps 10 young innovators transform into digipreneursByI-Venture @ ISBOnJune 10, 2022InNews 





Participating students got access to custom mentoring experience with more than 65 mentors, each an ISB alumnus.
The spirit of innovation runs deep in India, even in the remotest corners of the country where lakhs of children are coming up with solutions for problems – ranging from EMR transcription, female hygiene products, automated plant watering system, interactive yoga app, etc.
To support these young innovators, the I-Venture @ ISB partnered with Atal Innovation Mission (AIM), NITI Aayog to curate Atal Catalysts @ ISB. A one-of-its-kind program, Atal Catalysts @ ISB is designed to transform Tinkerpreneurs into digital product entrepreneurs or Digipreneurs. Mentors went on to nurture the top 100 business venture ideas by students that emerged from the ATL Tinkerpreneur Bootcamp.
Speaking about the partnership, Saumya Kumar, Director of I-Venture @ ISB said, “At I-Venture@ISB, we are committed to delivering an impact. We’re delighted and reassured to see that the Digipreneurs have gained so much from the Atal Catalysts @ ISB Program. We wish them good luck, and we promise to continue creating similar programs in the future as well.”
