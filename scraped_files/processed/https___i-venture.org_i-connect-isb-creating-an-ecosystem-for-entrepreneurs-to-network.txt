NewsI-Connect @ISB: Creating an ecosystem for entrepreneurs to networkByI-Venture @ ISBOnJune 28, 2022InNews 





[27 June, 2022] Bringing together various stakeholders of the start-up ecosystem, I-Venture @ISB – which fosters entrepreneurship and nurtures start-ups at the Indian School of Business – hosted I-Connect @ISB, an event to facilitate conversations between entrepreneurs/startups and leading venture capitalists. I-Connect was organised by I-Venture @ISB in partnership with Kalaari Capital, Endiya Partners and T-Hub at the ISB Hyderabad campus. 
The lead up to the networking dinner saw the I-Venture team holding discussions with Kalaari Capital and Endiya Partners, followed by a few startups incubated by I-Venture @ISB making presentations to the VCs.
Welcoming the attendees, Professor Bhagwan Chowdhry, Faculty Director, I-Venture @ISB, said that the goal is to exchange ideas and make connections. “This is first of the many such events,” he said.
Ms Vani Kola, Managing Director, Kalaari Capital; Mr Sateesh Andra, Managing Director, Endiya Partners; Mr Harkesh Mittal, Chairman, Startup India Seed Fund Committee; and Professor Madan Pillutla, Dean, ISB shared their insights at I-Connect@ISB.
Speaking at the event, Dean Madan Pillutla said, “At ISB, we are creating an ecosystem to connect individuals and incubators which would not only help them, but also contribute to the nation’s growth.”  
Ms Vani Kola said, “ISB has very special role to play. There’s a time and a place for what we can do in India in encouraging and exploring entrepreneurship to create meaningful value, not only for India but to be a beacon across the globe in the kind of the companies we create.”
Mr Harkesh Mittal expressed that he sees a wonderful future as this is the time to be in India. “This is the time to be a startup, to be an investor and continue to be a startup ecosystem,” he said.
The event saw participation of start-up founders, venture capitalists, incubator representatives, government officials, students, and ISB faculty. 
For Ashwin and Sandesh, founders of Ergon Mobility Private Limited- a startup incubated by D-Labs at ISB- attending the event was an ‘exhilarating’ experience. “Meeting industry leaders and seasoned entrepreneurs was definitely the key point of the event,” said Sandesh.
Two food start-ups- Wabs and Pro Dough- incubated by D-Labs had put up stalls at the event to showcase their products.
