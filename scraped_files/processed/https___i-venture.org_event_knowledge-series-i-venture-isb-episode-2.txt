Entrepreneurship is a complex and multifaceted endeavour that involves a range of skills and knowledge, from business planning and financial management to marketing and sales, team building, and more.
We believe by providing access to information and resources that will help founders develop these skills and knowledge, we can create a more vibrant and thriving startup ecosystem.
I-Venture @ ISB hosted Karan Agarwal, IP & Legal Head at Vakilsearch for the second episode of the knowledge series, where he shared his valuable insights, strategies, and legal nuances surrounding #intellectualproperty.
