Happy to announce that we’re organizing a Demo Day to mark the completion of the 1st cohort of our flagship I-WIN (Women of Innovation) Acceleration program on September 24, 2022.
I-WIN is focussed on propelling women founded/ co-founded startups in their scaling up journey by handholding them in every possible way. In this cohort, we closely worked with 16 women-led ventures, over the span of six months.
The 12 out 16 founders will be pitching their startups to 13+ investors which will further lead to a series of discussions to arrive at deal negotiation and final investments.
Date: 24th September 2022
Time: 10 am onwards
Venue: DLabs, ISB, Hyderabad campus
