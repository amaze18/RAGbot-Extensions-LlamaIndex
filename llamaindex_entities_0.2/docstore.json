Students learnt various skills such as latest technology skills, building a product, business models, marketing, branding, business finance, building an online store and finally how to pitch their venture. ATL Tinkerpreneur witnessed participation from over 9000 students and leveraged the knowledge and hands-on involvement of over 650 Mentors of Change to build a complete digital business venture at the end of the bootcamp. The Top 100 Students/teams were mapped to ISB to nurture their ideas further.\nI-Venture @ ISB, which fosters all entrepreneurial activities for the Institution and nurtures start-ups, took over the charge of developing, designing and executing the 2nd stage of the students\u0092 journey towards becoming entrepreneurs. Since then, the students/teams with the 100 most promising ideas have gone through a variety of Masterclasses and mentoring sessions that have added value to them and to their products.\nNo less than six Masterclasses were conducted, each of them taught using case studies and real-world examples. The topics covered a wide range:\u00a0\n1. Entrepreneurial Ecosystem & Mindset\n2. Competitor Analysis & Market Research\n3. Idea Validation, Product or Idea Development\n4. Digital Marketing & Branding\n5. Finance & HR\n6. Investor Pitch & Pitching Techniques\nWhile the Masterclasses added to the knowledge base of the students, the highlight of their journey at Atal Catalysts @ ISB was the customized mentoring experience that was curated for each of them. More than 65 mentors were part of the program, each of them an alumnus of ISB. Each of them came from different backgrounds and fields and brought different capabilities with them. The Atal Catalysts @ ISB team carefully analysed the areas of improvement for every idea and mapped it to the expertise of the right mentor. This ensured that the students got the most appropriate guidance they needed to enhance their product and develop the necessary entrepreneurial/business skills. The mentoring sessions were conducted one-on-one so that they provided personalized attention to each of the students/teams.\nOnce the products and pitches were refined, the difficult task of selecting the most promising ideas began. The Big Pitch, an event where the teams showcased their ideas to a panel, was conducted over two weekends. The sponsors at The Big Pitch were I-Venture @ ISB, PKF Sridhar & Santhanam, and Prasad Medikonda. The panellist said that they had a tough time shortlisting 10 out of the 20 ideas pitched.\nWith the sponsorships, the selected students/teams will work on developing the app or website before taking them to market.\nThese are the 10 most promising ideas that emerged from The Big Pitch:\nPress Release: https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1827009\n       Next Post \n        The Atal Catalysts @ ISB program helps 10 young innovators transform into digipreneurs       \nNewsletter Updates\n    Enter your email address below and subscribe to our newsletter   \n    Subscribe   \nI accept the Privacy Policy\nLeave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

It was set up as a platform for authors to collaborate with peers and co-author books.\nIts founder, Saumita Banerjee envisioned the start-up as one that empowers authors to bring their ideas to life. At LetsAuthor, the authors come from various walks of life, and also from across continents. The team strives toward publishing books to high editorial and production standards. LetsAuthor publishes in the areas of popular science; business & management; mind, body & spirit; lifestyle; general non-fiction, as well as in fiction (short stories and anthologies), and books for children and young adults.\nQuite a diverse list of subjects for a publishing house that is still in its start-up phase. But this diversity is only a reflection of Saumita\u2019s own diverse interests. She is an Entrepreneur and a technology enthusiast with experience across Industrial R&D, Technology Analysis, and more recently, Book Publishing. Saumita is an ME, PhD in Biotechnology and is an alumnus of premiere Indian institutes BITS Pilani and IIT Kharagpur.\nA chance conversation that Saumita had with the CEO of a leading Open Innovation company is how the seeds of LetsAuthor were sown. He had spent years working in the area of innovation and had a lot to share. He wanted to write a book but what he didn\u2019t have was the time to write the entire book all by himself.\nLike the name of the company suggests, Saumita decided to turn writing from a solitary pursuit into a collaborative exercise. Today over 80 authors are collaborating to write their books on the \u2018LetsAuthor\u2019 platform, with constant support from their Commissioning Editors, and their Community Manager.

This resulted in a Sales role but at every crucial point in her career, Lochan continued to seek clarity and support. She tried to answer the question \u2013 \u2018What should I do next?\u2019 but in the absence of any customized guidance, she ended up taking generic career advice. In 2019, when she started working as a career coach, she realized that there were a whole lot of other professionals like herself who had faced similar dilemmas at different times in their career.\nThat is what led to the genesis of OfExperiences, a platform that builds, develops and equips professionals who are undergoing career transitions by running niche cohort-based programs for them across career stages, and providing them with relevant information, personalized guidance, and real connections to help them navigate through their transitional phase.\nOFExperiences also acts as a bridge between such professionals and organizations that are looking for similar talent. Not only does Lochan\u2019s brainchild help organizations with ready talent, but they also provide valuable behavioural insights that enable the organization\u2019s talent hiring and development efforts.\nFor Lochan, giving shape to her dream has not been as easy as getting the idea itself. It took some time to design the right business model and several experiments, market explorations and positioning exercises to get to the root of it all. While building awareness is a recurring challenge, I-WIN\u2019s accelerator program has provided a unique combination of workshops, mentors and networking opportunities.\nLochan feels that the network with other startups has been very encouraging and has opened up conversations for potential collaborations. We hope Lochan and OFExperiences can capitalize on each opportunity that comes their way!\nThis is one of the sixteen stories to introduce you to the current cohort of start-ups being incubated under I-WIN, I-Venture @ ISB\u2019s flagship program for women-founded and co-founded start-ups.\n# I-WIN# Women Entrepreneurs\n       Previous Post \n        [I-WIN Startup Stories]  In a world where fitness is measured by weight alone, Lami.Fit stands out by a mile       \n       Next Post \n        [I-WIN Startup Stories] Meet the duo Anagha and Diwakar as they assist UG students and early professionals in advancing their careers       \nNewsletter Updates\n    Enter your email address below and subscribe to our newsletter   \n    Subscribe   \nI accept the Privacy Policy\nLeave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Lakshmi\u2019s work with elite sports teams, like the Indian Cricket team, and Amol\u2019s entrepreneurial run is what brought the duo together. Lami.Fit (lami.fit) is the perfect example of what happens when intuition, knowledge, experience and technology come together.\nThe first-of-its-kind healthtech platform that uses DNA, and blood & body markers to predict health risks, Lami.fit synthesises the findings to curate personalised health plans that can prevent and reverse lifestyle diseases like diabetes, thyroid, PCOS, heart risks & chronic gut disorders.\nThis app isn\u2019t just great news for those of us with a sedentary lifestyle \u2013 it also helps athletes & individuals to reach the peak of their health and fitness. The makers of the app believe that every individual is different and that the nutritional and fitness requirements for people vary greatly. A general nutrition plan can only do so much and does not have the ability to fundamentally solve underlying health problems.\nLakshmi recalls her first success that led to Lami.Fit\u2019s birth. She had recommended a few dietary changes to her partner\u2019s father who was dealing with diabetes, and in no time there was a substantial improvement in his condition. Not only did his dependency on medicines reduce, but his overall health improved as well. That was the moment when Lakshmi decided to make her experience accessible to all. A partnership with Amol, who brought an entrepreneurial mindset, cleared the stage for Lami.Fit\u2019s launch.\nThe support from I-win has helped Lakshmi and Amol a great deal. Having mentors and programs that hand-hold at each step where guidance is required was invaluable to Lami.Fit\u2019s journey. The founders believe that the \u201cStrategically structured program\u201d added value to the product and to the marketing as well.\nAs Lami.Fit grows month on month, we wish the founders good luck in their endeavours to take health and fitness to every smartphone user!\nThis is one of the sixteen stories to introduce you to the current cohort of start-ups being incubated under I-WIN, I-Venture @ ISB\u2019s flagship program for women-founded and co-founded start-ups.\n# I-WIN# Women Entrepreneurs\n       Previous Post \n        [I-WIN Startup Stories] Discover how Saumita Banerjee is enabling authors with LetsAuthor       \n       Next Post \n        [I-WIN Startup Stories] How Lochan helps individuals deal with their career related dilemmas.       \nNewsletter Updates\n    Enter your email address below and subscribe to our newsletter   \n    Subscribe   \nI accept the Privacy Policy\nLeave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

The company, which was then making uniforms, had to shut down. And with it, the dreams of 91 women who were being rehabilitated by Sonia\u2019s company were also on the verge of shutting down.\nTo Sonia\u2019s trained mind, it was only the start of challenges. An alumnus of ISB herself, she wasted no time in restarting Monk & Mei out of the garage in her home with just one Karigar (skilled artisan), where Masterjis (experienced cutters) used to come, pick up the fabric, make garments and deliver them. There was no looking back from here.\nToday Monk & Mei (monkandmei.com) is an indo-western luxury women\u2019s wear brand that is both affordable and responsible. In just 500 days, the brand has cultivated an organic following of more than 15 thousand women and 250-plus celebrities/influencers. All this has happened, like Sonia says, because of its strong team of 20-plus designers, merchandisers, community builders, and skilled craftswomen and men.\nNot only is it among one of the top sellers in several categories on Nykaa Fashion, but garments from Monk & Mei can also be bought off Myntra for Earth, Tata IndiLuxe and it\u2019s now even catering to the NRI market through Pernia\u2019s Pop-Up Shop.\nThe initial success of the Odisha initiative inspired Sonia to create a designer brand that is both responsible, and conscious; one which helps build a cleaner, greener, and more inclusive planet. Through their efforts, the good people at Monk & Mei have distributed 15,000 seed tags, 7500 jute bags, and 15,000 masks. That, along with the employment it generates for rural artisans, makes Monk & Mei a truly sensitive brand.\nSonia feels that being incubated through the I-Win program made their way of working even more structured. They connected with the right people to resolve the right challenges which helped them address some of their core problem areas.\nMonk & Mei has accomplished in 500 days what few brands can do. We wish the whole team more power to achieve their goals for the next 500!\nThis is one of the the sixteen startups in the current cohort being incubated under I-WIN, I-Venture @ ISB\u2019s flagship program for women-founded and co-founded start-ups. I-Venture@ ISB is proud to take them through our I-WIN Accelerator program and we wish the venture a successful journey!\n# I-WIN# Women Entrepreneurs\n       Previous Post \n        I-Venture @ ISB portfolio startup WABS-Without A Break was featured in WoW!

It also is looking to draft its alumni members as mentors to nurture startup ideas into scalable businesses, said Prof Bhagwan Chowdhry, Faculty Director, I-Venture, which fosters entrepreneurship and nurtures startups at ISB. It administers business incubators and facilitates the conversion of startups into entrepreneurial ventures. It has various programmes that cater to ventures of all stages.\n\u201cWe have stepped up activities related to nurturing the entrepreneurship ecosystem. We were doing them in pockets. Now, we are bringing them under one umbrella. We are engaging with alumni members asking them to don the hats of mentors,\u201d he said. ISB has more than 13,000 alumni members in 60-plus countries.\n\u201cThe success or the failure of the startups is not just decided by the idea but also by the team executing it. Our alumni members will nurture ideas into successful businesses. I think the alumni network is the biggest source of brain power. They will do the hand-holding,\u201d he said. Depending on ideas, alumni members, who might be latent entrepreneurs, may opt to turn co-founders in the ventures. On the approach that ISB will take, he said ideas will be matched with the alumni members for taking it forward. It is also making efforts to work with other entrepreneurship ecosystem players and educational institutions. The focus is on hosting startup activities jointly and also bringing teams together,\u201d said Chowdhry.\nI-Venture \u201cThere might be students in India where they have an idea but see their use cases in Europe, the US or other countries. Many budding entrepreneurs may not be aware of the legal system in those countries, the startup ecosystem there or finding the right mentors there. Conversely, there might be ideas in other countries that can solve a problem in India. We will play a bridge to connect ideas with local players, policymakers and others,\u201d he told\u00a0Telangana Today. ISB will work with the venture capital funding community and external funding agencies. ISB has also been seeing some startups coming to the campus placement drives for recruitment.\n\u201cBusiness proliferations happen when the markets are hot. There will be some shocks when the economy is not doing good. That is the nature of entrepreneurship. All the startups will not succeed. However, we should continue to allow experimentation to happen. There will be upswings, shocks, and closures and those that survive will be more robust. There are some job losses happening now. They all are talented people. They will find work with other startups or companies,\u201d he said about the recent job losses in the startups.\nISB is also doing an entrepreneurship programme under CM ST Entrepreneurship and Innovation (CMSTEI) scheme to support and promote entrepreneurs among scheduled tribes of Telangana. The Tribal Cooperative Finance Corporation (TRICOR) is the primary stakeholder in this programme. \\I-Venture\\ More than 170 startups graduated 70 raised funding Total funding raised by startups is about Rs 730 crore More than 2,000 jobs created by startups\n       Previous Post \n        The Atal Catalysts @ ISB program helps 10 young innovators transform into digipreneurs       \n       Next Post \n        I-Connect @ISB: Creating an ecosystem for entrepreneurs to network       \nNewsletter Updates\n    Enter your email address below and subscribe to our newsletter   \n    Subscribe   \nI accept the Privacy Policy\nLeave a ReplyCancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

Out of this, there is excess \ndependence on local informal buyers by the majority of small and \nmarginal farmers which leads to less than the market price for their \nproduce. Due to inadequate market access coupled with poor \npost-harvest handling, there is on an average 40% crop loss incurred \nby the farmers. Making farming a lucrative profession through ef\ufb01cient \nmarket linkage is the immediate need of the hour for the nation\u2019s food \nsecurity.\nIn India, there are 2 million street vendors who vend F&V catering to \nthe demand of over 1/3rd of the urban population. Almost all of them \ngo to mandi (distance 5km or more) and purchase poorly handled \nproduce with a capital loan at high-interest rate from informal lenders. \nHigh operational costs and inef\ufb01cient supply chain drastically impact \nthe livelihood of the street vendors. With an ever-increasing urban \npopulation, there is a greater need to build an ef\ufb01cient F&V supply \nchain to street vendors improving affordability, quality along with \nreducing time and wastage. Connecting FPOs and street vendors \ntowards building a potent system is a win-win solution at large.\nSOLUTION\nOur solution is to enable market linkages to the FPOs by connecting \nthem to pushcart vendors by driving end-to-end operations. \nFarmers are informed of the closest mandi prices for the day which \nacts as a benchmark in our price negotiation maintaining \ntransparency. Field level of\ufb01cers visit the farm locations to check the \nquality parameters and oversee handling and loading of the produce. \nThis then is transported to our strategic cluster locations in the city \ndelivering it directly to the street vendors. Aggregation of the produce \nfor a group of street vendors delivered at the cluster level helps in \nbuilding an ef\ufb01cient supply chain, minimize handling of the produce, \neliminates the need of the street vendor to visit the mandi and brings \ndown the sourcing cost. This freshly harvested produce is supplied to \nthe street vendor in our unique pay-as-you-sell model which \neliminates the over-dependency on the loan sharks bringing down \ntheir operational costs and also building a mechanism to develop their \ncredit history enabling them to avail mainstream \ufb01nancial services. \nOnce the supply chain is stabilized, we plan to develop one-of-its-kind \ndigitally enabled electric cart empowering the existing pushcart \nvendors where the end consumer would be able to order through \ne-commerce which is ful\ufb01lled by delivering at their doorstep. This will \nhelp reduce drudgery during mobility, get online orders, greater cart \nvolume, sales analytics, inventory management, digital billing and \ndigital payments.www.handelsocialventures.comFOUNDERS\nAbhilash Varma\nFounder\nHandel Ventures\nSECTOR\nAgri Post Processing\nAccelerationSTAGE\n\u20b9 40 LakhsREVENUE", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2975, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b6414b62-6942-4edf-8352-cbb1384cfc9e": {"__data__": {"id_": "b6414b62-6942-4edf-8352-cbb1384cfc9e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "AIC Startup3_Profiles.pdf", "file_path": "/content/Dlabs_Data/AIC Startup3_Profiles.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3634380, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-17"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d555a884-ae9e-49f5-a102-5e477de9728f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "AIC Startup3_Profiles.pdf", "file_path": "/content/Dlabs_Data/AIC Startup3_Profiles.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3634380, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "5baa51895de22e22087d4bba60547414cc37d5534b524d772149035ba389e008", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "83763c2d-e8e5-44fe-a222-41f7f75fa32e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "AIC Startup3_Profiles.pdf", "file_path": "/content/Dlabs_Data/AIC Startup3_Profiles.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 3634380, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "96e2d338a1a76831dcdd45973dc4bc494da85015b0d607120d429e5f3fba025a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "90cdf7ee-cac8-4af0-aa3a-4f6d18a85d80", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ad92fa0377afd52cfc17668736818abbe6c87469f42b5f220771722673d4fc2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "PROBLEM\nBuying a plant, especially the desired variety or plant species, is very \ndif\ufb01cult nowadays.

Also, use of web-based\nopen sources to derive signals for the startup success prediction task\nhas been investigated, but signals picked were limited to direct men-\ntions in the form of web links. We gathered data of 5000+ startups\nover a period of 4 years. We used structured data about the startup\nfounders, team size, product offering, industry sector, funding raised so\nfar, as well as textual information about their company. Using these\ndata fields, we trained a machine learning model with multiple fea-\ntures using random forest technique. We show that utilizing companies\u2019\ntextual data on their product offering/business plan provides a sub-\nstantial performance boost in comparison to only using structured data\nabout the startup ecosystem. We provide an in-depth analysis of the\ndeveloped machine learning (ML) model as well as different ML tech-\nniques experimented to provide a quantitative comparison among them.\nThis has helped us obtain insights into easily discoverable quantita-\ntive signals as well as market factors influencing the startup funding.\nKeywords: Predictive modelling, Structured data, Text Analysis, Random\nForest\n1", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1831, "text_template": "[Excerpt from document]\n{metadata_str}\nExcerpt:\n-----\n{content}\n-----\n", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "43918ddd-eca4-4a3f-859a-146ac5564f92": {"__data__": {"id_": "43918ddd-eca4-4a3f-859a-146ac5564f92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Startup Success Predictor.pdf", "file_path": "/content/Dlabs_Data/Startup Success Predictor.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 597066, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-17", "entities": ["Fig"]}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67b089af-3b97-4ef8-b266-6024ea43e246", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "Startup Success Predictor.pdf", "file_path": "/content/Dlabs_Data/Startup Success Predictor.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 597066, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "36b07c84783c4ddaf015d6f6b06239a24aa7b4bacccd38665cc91ad60532a94b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e7bba075-4d79-4abd-a225-5aa45a25c30f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "Startup Success Predictor.pdf", "file_path": "/content/Dlabs_Data/Startup Success Predictor.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 597066, "creation_date": "2024-03-17", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-17", "last_accessed_date": "2024-03-17"}, "hash": "28ee7fb944d054958b5dd8bd68becb09dee527c162eb04a15c40e46b047ba058", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "467ec571-6470-4378-8d6f-19885d647c7e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7af6de1a8a241747bd6d9cdcea4480cb8d46ab4bef617b1608f0d7deb43175c9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "CODE 2023\n2 Startup Success\n1 Introduction\nStartups are integral part of the economy [1, 2] .
